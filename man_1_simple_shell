.SH DESCRIPTION
The Bivalve shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the termi- \
nal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the \
program that is running when a user logs into the system. The shell implements a language \ 
that has flow control contructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of features in addition to data\storage, along with the built in history and line editing capabilities. It also has features to \
aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive\ and non-interactive use (shell scripts). Commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put\ into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.SH EXAMPLE:
$PATH:
.PP
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:

Bivalve shell has two builtin commands. It also integrates with other commands \
that can be located in the PATH. The output of Bivalve shell is to replicate \
exactly as the shell 'sh' or 'bash'.

The Bivalve shell takes commands from files, shell scripts and user input in both interactive or non-interactive mode.

.SH INITIALIZATION

using: gcc. Then run the output file by calling it whether \
